## About

Simple interactive game using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). The game features a resizable window where a blue rectangle (representing the player's character) can be moved in four directions using arrow keys, with boundaries set to prevent it from going off-screen. The 'R' key enables rotation of the rectangle, adding a dynamic aspect to its appearance. Additionally, pressing the 'C' key triggers a color change for the rectangle. The game also displays real-time updates on the rectangle's position. Overall, this code provides a foundation for understanding basic game mechanics, user input handling, and graphics manipulation within the SFML framework.
